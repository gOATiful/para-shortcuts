This plugin serves useful commands to setup and manage your knowledge using the PARA method.

## The PARA Method
A full article on the PARA method and it's benefits can be found on this [blog post](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) by Tiago Forte.

Brief summery of the PARA folder structure:
- **Projects**: A project is "a series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline".
- **Area**: An area of responsibility is "a sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time".
- **Resource**: A resource is "a topic or theme of ongoing interest". 
- **Archive**: Archives include "inactive items from the other three categories".

Additional: Put personally relevant information in Areas, and generally useful information in Resources.
